Overview</h1>
<p>The benchmark shipped in the SNPE SDK consists of a set of python scripts that runs a network on a target Android/LinuxEmbedded device and collect performance metrics. It uses executables and libraries found in the SDK package to run a DLC file on target, using a set of inputs for the network, and a file that points to that set of inputs.</p>
<p>The input to the benchmark scripts is a configuration file in JSON format. The SDK ships with a configuration file for running the AlexNet model that is created in the SNPE SDK. SDK users are encouraged to create their own configuration files and use the benchmark scripts to run on target to collect timing and memory consumption measurements.</p>
<p>The configuration file allows the user to specify:</p><ul>
<li>Name of the benchmark (i.e., AlexNet)</li>
<li>Host path to use for storing results</li>
<li>Device paths to use (where to push the necessary files for running the benchmark)</li>
<li>Device to run the benchmark on (only one device is supported per run)</li>
<li>Hostname/IP of remote machine to which devices are connected</li>
<li>Number of times to repeat the run</li>
<li>Model specifics (name, location of dlc, location of inputs)</li>
<li>SNPE runtime configuration(s) to use (combination of CPU, GPU, GPU_FP16 and DSP)</li>
<li>Which measurements to take ("mem" and/or "timing")</li>
<li>Profiling level of measurements ("off", "basic" or "detailed")</li>
</ul>

</pre><h3><a class="anchor" id="viewing_results"></a>
Viewing the Results (csv File or json File)</h3>
<p>All results are stored in the "HostResultDir" that is specified in the configuration json file. The benchmark creates time-stamped directories for each benchmark run. All timing results are stored in microseconds.</p>
<p>For your convenience, a "latest_results" link is created that always points to the most recent run.</p>
<pre class="fragment"># In alexnet_sample.json, "HostResultDir" is set to "alexnet/results"
cd $SNPE_ROOT/benchmarks/alexnet/results
# Notice the time stamped directories and the "latest_results" link.
cd $SNPE_ROOT/benchmarks/alexnet/results/latest_results

<p>All fields are required.</p><ul>
<li><b>Name:</b> The name of this configuration, e.g., AlexNet</li>
<li><b>HostRootPath:</b> The top level output folder on the host. It can be an absolute path or a relative path to the current working directory.</li>
<li><b>HostResultDir:</b> The folder on the host where all benchmark results are put. It can be an absolute path or a relative path to the current working directory.</li>
<li><b>DevicePath:</b> The folder on the device where all benchmark-related data and artifacts are put, e.g., /data/local/tmp/snpebm</li>
<li><b>Devices:</b> The serial number of the device that the benchmark runs on. Only one device is currently supported.</li>
<li><b>Runs:</b> The number of times that the benchmark runs for each of the "Runtime" and "Measurements" run combinations</li>
<li><b>Model:</b><ul>
<li><b>Name:</b> The name of the DNN model, e.g., alexnet</li>

<li><b>Data:</b> A list of data files or folders that are listed in InputList file. It can be an absolute path or a relative path to the current working directory. If the path is a folder, all contents of that folder will be pushed to the device.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Runtimes:</b> Possible values are "GPU", "GPU_FP16", "DSP" and "CPU". You can use any combination of these.</li>
<li><b>Measurements:</b> Possible values are "timing" and "mem". You can set either one or both of these values. Each measurement type is measured alone for each run.</li>
</ul>
<p>Optional fields:</p><ul>
<li><b>CpuFallback:</b> Possible values are true and false. Indicates whether or not the network can fallback to CPU when a layer is not available on a runtime. Default value is false.</li>
<li><b>HostName:</b> Hostname/IP of remote machine to which devices are connected. Default value is 'localhost'.</li>

If this field is absent, it is executed for all possible runtimes(default case).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Architecture support</b></p>
<p>Android ARM 32-bit and AARCH 64-bit are both supported. In addition to Android, there is limited support for LinuxEmbedded, where only the timing measurement is supported.</p>
<p>Runtime and measurement are concatenated to make a full run combination name, e.g.,</p><ul>
<li>"GPU_timing": GPU runtime, timing measurement</li>
<li>"CPU_mem": CPU runtime, memory measurement</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that for each specified runtime, there are multiple sets of timing measurements which differ only in the tensor format (<a class="el" href="cplus_plus_tutorial.html#cpp_tutorial_load_input_itensors">Using ITensors</a> and <a class="el" href="cplus_plus_tutorial.html#cpp_tutorial_load_input_user_buffers">Using User Buffers</a>).

<li>
"DSP_ub_tf8_timing": Timing measurement on DSP runtime using UserBuffer with TF8 encoding </li>
<li>
"DSP_ub_float_timing": Timing measurement on DSP runtime using UserBuffer with float encoding </li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="run_the_benchmark"></a>
Run the Benchmark</h2>
<p>The easiest way to run the benchmark is to specify the -a option, which will run the benchmark on the lone device connected to your computer.</p>
<pre class="fragment">cd $SNPE_ROOT/benchmarks
python snpe_bench.py -c yourmodel.json -a
</pre><p>The benchmark will do an md5sum on the host files (those specified in the JSON configuration) and on the device files. Because of the md5sum check, files needed for the benchmark run has to be available on the host.</p>
<p>For any file that exists both on host and on the device with mismatch md5, the benchmark will copy the file from host to target and issue a warning message letting you know that the local files do not match the device files. This is done so that you can be sure that the results you get from a benchmark run accurately reflect the files specified in the JSON file.</p>
<p><b>Other options</b></p>
<p><b> -v option</b><br />
Allows you to override the device ID specified in the config file, so that the same config file can be used across multiple devices. You can use this instead of -a, if you have multiple devices attached.</p>
<p><b> -o option</b><br />
Result output base directory override applies only if relative paths are specified for HostRootPath and HostResultsDir. It allows you to pool the output regardless of where you run the benchmark from.</p>
<p><b> -t option</b><br />
OS Type override currently supports Android arm (armeabi-v7a), Android aarch64 (arm64-v8a), and LinuxEmbedded devices.</p>
<p><b> -b option</b><br />
Allows you to specify type of input and output user buffers.</p>
<p><b> -p option</b><br />
Allows you to profile performance in different operating modes.</p>
<p><b> -l option</b><br />
Allows you to specify the level of performance profiling.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="benchmark_read_results"></a>
Reading the Results</h3>
<p>Open the results(CSV file or JSON file) in your &lt;HostResultsDir&gt;/latest_results folder to view your results. (&lt;HostResultsDir&gt; is what you specified in your json configuration file.)</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="measurement_methodology"></a>
Measurement Methodology</h2>
<p>In all cases, the snpe-net-run executable is used to load a model and run inputs through the model.</p>
<p><b>Performance ("timing")</b></p>
<p>Timing measurements are taken using internal timing utilities inside the SNPE libraries. When snpe-net-run is executed, the libraries will log timing info to a file. This file is then parsed offline to retrieve total inference times and per-layer times.</p>
<p>The total inference times include both the per-layer computation times plus overhead such as data movements between layers, as well as into and out of runtimes, whereas the per-layer times are strictly computational times for each layer. For smaller networks the overhead can be quite significant relative to computational time, particularly when offloading the networks to run on GPU or DSP.</p>
<p>As well, further optimizations present on the GPU/DSP may cause layer times to be mis-attributed, in the case of neuron conv-neuron or fc-neuron pairs. When executing on GPU the total time of the pairs would be assigned to convs, whereas for DSP they would be assigned to the neurons.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="benchmark_dependencies"></a>
